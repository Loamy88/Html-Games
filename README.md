Some games made with chat-gpt, run with bookmarklet: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Loamy88/Html-Games/main/bookmarklet
password is let-me-in, I don't think somebody with a bit of knowledge on encrypting will be fooled by base64, but just for fun.
note: you may need to run the bookmarklet on google.com, for me I couldn't open it while on another website.
I recommend not playing fortnite
